Qt 4 makes it easier than ever to write multithreaded applications. More
classes have been made usable from non-GUI threads, and the signals and slots
mechanism can now be used to communicate between threads.

Additionally, it is now possible to move objects between threads.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
