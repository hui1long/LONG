    \brief The Icon component displays an icon from the icon theme.

    The icon theme contains a set of standard icons referred to by their name.
    Using icons whenever possible enhances consistency accross applications.
    Each icon has a name and can have different visual representations depending
    on the size requested.

    Icons can also be colorized. Setting the \l color property will make all pixels
    with the \l keyColor (by default #808080) colored.

    Example:
    \qml
    Icon {
        width: 64
        height: 64
        name: "search"
    }
    \endqml

    Example of colorization:
    \qml
    Icon {
        width: 64
        height: 64
        name: "search"
        color: UbuntuColors.warmGrey
    }
    \endqml

    Icon themes are created following the
    \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html}{Freedesktop Icon Theme Specification}.

       \note The complete list of icons available in Ubuntu is not published yet.
           For now please refer to the folders where the icon themes are installed:
           \list
             \li Ubuntu Touch: \l file:/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mobile
             \li Ubuntu Desktop: \l file:/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark
           \endlist
           These 2 separate icon themes will be merged soon.
