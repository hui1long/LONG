// FIXME(loicm) It would be nice to have a draggable thumb to toggle the switch,

    \brief Switch is a component with two states, checked or unchecked. It can
    be used to set boolean options. The behavior is the same as \l CheckBox, the
    only difference is the graphical style.

    \b{This component is under heavy development.}

    \l {http://design.ubuntu.com/apps/building-blocks/toggles}{See also the Design Guidelines on Toggles}.

    Example:
    \qml
    Item {
        Switch {
            checked: true
        }
    }
    \endqml
*/
CheckBox {
    id: switchItem
    style: Theme.createStyleComponent("SwitchStyle.qml", switchItem)
}
